# PropelAuth

Add authentication and authorization to your [B2B application](https://www.propelauth.com/b2b).

Your frontend gets a beautiful, safe, and customizable login screen. Your backend gets easy authorization with just a few lines of code. You get an easy-to-use dashboard to config and manage everything.

- Any product that cares about security needs to have [Two-factor Authentication](https://docs.propelauth.com/overview/2fa/), and we give that to you, in every plan, with no extra coding on your part.
- If you want to make it easy on your users to sign in, we offer [SAML](https://docs.propelauth.com/overview/saml/) and [SSO](https://docs.propelauth.com/reference/social-login/).
- When your product launches it's exciting to watch people signing up. We have [Slack Sign-up Notifications](https://docs.propelauth.com/overview/notifications/) for just this reason.
- [Our prices are transparent](https://www.propelauth.com/pricing), unlike some competitors, and we don't gatekeep basic features behind "bonus" charges.
- If you have a new startup, check out our [Free until Funded](https://www.propelauth.com/free-until-funded-startup-plan) plan.
- If you're not a startup, and just want to try us out, we also offer a [limited free plan](https://www.propelauth.com/pricing).

Here are our current frontend and backend SDKs, all available on GitHub and via the usual package managers. If you don't see what you need, contact us.
